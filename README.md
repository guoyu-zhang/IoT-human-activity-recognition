# Human Activity Recognition using the Respeck Monitor

The aim of this project is to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) enabled mobile application that leverages machine learning to analyse physical activity, social signals and sleep quality using sensor data.

The app connects to a Bluetooth device (Respeck) which is attached to the userâ€™s lower left ribcage. Machine learning models run inferences on this data to infer user activities or sleeping patterns. These analyses can then be visualised using interactive graphs.
